Consensus science advice regarding status assessments from a CSAS peer-review process in 2023. Summarizes methods and results from an evaluation of candidate algorithms (i.e., decision trees implemented as computer code), and recommendation related to implementation process for routine status assessments across species and areas.

This paper reviewed status indicators used in various national and international assessment processes (IUCN, COSEWIC), developed candidate indicators specifically for assessing the status of Pacific salmon conservation units under the WSP, tested the candidate indicators in simulation analyses, and recommended a set of 4 metrics with associated benchmarks.
