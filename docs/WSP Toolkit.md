# Wild Salmon Policy Status Toolkit

Wild Salmon Policy status assessments for Pacific salmon CUs follow a multi-criteria approach that was developed over 15 years of research, application, and refinement. 
This approach was built on the status assessment methods developed by the IUCN and COSEWIC ([DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009](./References.md)). 
This includes the use of standardized status metrics that were established globally through the IUCN ([Mace et al. 2008; IUCN 2022])(./References.md) and have been adopted 
in Canada by COSEWIC ([COSEWIC 2010](./References.md)). Standardized metrics enable the objective and transparent assessment of status, and the production of consistent status results. 

The WSP status assessment approach has been applied to assess Fraser Sockeye ([Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020](./References.md)), 
Interior Fraser Coho ([DFO 2015](./References.md)), and Southern BC Chinook ([DFO 2016](./References.md)). In each of these processes, metrics were selected from a toolkit developed 
by Holt (2009) and Holt et al. (2009). Specific metrics used for each assessment were conditional on data availability, quantity, and quality.

For each metric, lower and upper benchmarks delineate, respectively, the Red to Amber and the Amber to Green WSP biological status zones. The lower benchmark is set at a level that provides 
a substantial buffer between the benchmark and the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) classification of ‘endangered’.
