# Determining WSP Integrated Statuses

There are three potential ways to integrate metric statuses into an official WSP status for a CU. 

### Large-scale expert-driven workshops
The original WSP status integration approach used a Delphi method to reach consensus on CU statuses across participating salmon population specialists. Participants relied on CU metrics and additional information on CU productivity, abundance, and exploitation over time to assess statuses. These processes required significant time investment including the participation of 10-40 Pacific salmon experts for up to three days in a workshop setting. This method was applied in the first WSP status assessment for Fraser Sockeye ([Grant et al. 2011, Grant & Pestal 2012](./References.md)), and in the assessments for Interior 
Fraser Coho ([DFO 2015](./References.md)) and Southern BC Chinook ([DFO 2016](References.md)).

### Streamlined workshops
The streamlined version of the expert-driven approach was developed and implemented for the re-assessment of Fraser Sockeye CUs in 2017 ([Grant et al. 2020](./References.md)). Since this group of CUs had been assessed previously, methods had already been established for preparing data, calculating metrics, and producing data summaries for these CUs, and just required updating. Further, since most Fraser Sockeye experts had already been involved in status assessments, and precedents for assessing Fraser Sockeye statuses had already been established, this streamlined process required less time and fewer participants.

## Issues
Despite the development of the streamlined approach, both of the expert-driven processes described above require considerable work and time to implement. This includes time spent preparing data, calculating 
metric statuses, producing data summaries, organizing workshops, writing and editing CSAS research documents, and completing CSAS peer-review processes, which require another set of formal meetings 
and therefore multi-day time commitments from 20-40 participants. 

Overall, these processes take years to complete, and have only been applied to three groups of Pacific salmon CUs as a result (one group was assessed a second time five years after the first assessment).  

Each of the four completed expert-driven WSP status assessments flagged the need for rapid status assessment methods (DFO 2012; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016, Grant et al. 2020). 

This need has grown particularly strong over time, as drastic declines have been observed in salmon abundances and productivity, and as global climate change has accelerated (Bush and Lemmen 2019; Grant et al. 2019; Irvine et al. 2019; Crozier et al. 2019, 2021). Given these changing conditions, Pacific salmon status assessments are likely to become rapidly out of date if not updated frequently. 

### Rapid status assessments
The third approach to determining integrated statuses delivers on the escalating need for streamlined, rapid status assessments, and is described in detail [here](./WSP Rapid Status.md).
