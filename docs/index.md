# **DFO's State of the Salmon Program**

The State of the Salmon Program was created to track and understand trends in Canadian Pacific salmon populations through collaborative processes, improved reporting 
and the development of analytical tools.
Broad declines in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances have been linked to global climate change and other factors, such as 
deteriorating habitats, increased fish disease, and invasive species (Grant et al. 2019). Given these trends, regular tracking of 
the state and distribution of salmon biodiversity is increasingly important.


## **Status Assessments for Wild Pacific Salmon**

DFOâ€™s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) Strategy 1 outlines a broad approach to tracking salmon biodiversity through standardized monitoring of wild salmon statuses. 
DFO has developed a status assessment tool kit that is customized to the complex life histories and population structures of Pacific salmon ([Holt et al. 2009](./References.md), [Holt 2009] (./References.md)), 
and has applied this toolkit to four groups of Pacific salmon Conservation Units (CUs) through WSP Integrated Status Assessments (Grant & Pestal 2012, DFO 2015, DFO 2016, Grant et al. 2020)
Subsequently, DFO's State of the Salmon Program developed an approach to rapidly assess the biological status of Pacific Salmon Conservation Units (CUs) under the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) (Pestal et al. 2023, DFO 2024).   
The *State of the Salmon* program is coordinating and supporting local implementation of the rapid assessment approach across species and areas.

Providing a clear, consistent picture of Pacific salmon status will support decision-making processes. Specifically, annual tracking of Pacific salmon CU statuses will improve our ability to: 
1) assess the impacts of climate change and other stressors on salmon; 
2) identify and prioritize across management actions while improving the transparency of management decisions and trade-offs; and, 
3) evaluate the effectiveness of management strategies aimed at conserving and rebuilding CUs (i.e. monitoring and evaluation).
 

## **Climate Adaptation**

Some general patterns in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances are emerging, concurrent with climate and habitat changes. Chinook are declining in abundance throughout their BC and Yukon range, and many sockeye and coho 
populations are declining, most notably at southern latitudes. Pink salmon are generally not exhibiting long-term declines, as were chum salmon until more recently. 

We do not anticipate that long-term salmon survival patterns will reflect those we have seen historically, given the environmental changes that have been observed in recent years, and those predicted for the 
future in B.C. and the Yukon. Climate change vulnerability assessments for Pacific salmon on the west coast of the U.S. indicate that vulnerability to climate change varies across Pacific salmon species and 
populations, determined by the habitats they occupy and their life histories (Crozier et al. 2019). Climate change vulnerability is largely higher for southern and interior populations, and is influenced by the amount 
of time salmon spend in fresh water and estuaries (Crozier et al. 2019). These patterns corroborate some of the general trends that have been observed across Pacific salmon populations in Canada (Grant et al. 2019).
As environmental conditions continue to change, climate change vulnerability assessments will be a valuable tool for providing a longer-range outlook for Canadian Pacific salmon. Such assessments will provide a more 
detailed understanding of the distribution of climate vulnerabilities across Pacific salmon populations in Canada to better inform current and future management decisions, and support efforts to adapt to the changing 
salmon landscape (MacDonald and Grant 2023).
